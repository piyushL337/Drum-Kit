# Drum-Kit

The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. 
It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user. 
I completed this project earlier in my JavaScript learning phase. 
I found it quite confusing because I had never used the HTML audio API or the selection of DOM elements using the date-key attribute.
Drum Kit project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Talking about the gameplay, it is a simple musical game. 
It is a simple arcade game which is played with a tap. 
The user has to use the keyboard in order to play the game. Also, this project uses the NodeJs environment for setting up the server.
